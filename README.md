bdidbdndjd ddj1. The Socratic Method

The Socratic Method is a way of teaching or engaging in dialogue by:

Asking a series of thoughtful questions, rather than giving direct answers.

Encouraging critical thinking, self-examination, and reasoned debate.

Often exposing contradictions in someone’s beliefs, pushing them to clarify or rethink.

Example:

Instead of saying, “Justice means fairness,” Socrates might ask, “What is justice? Can something be just for one person and unjust for another?”
